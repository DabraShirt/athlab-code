# Data Split Configuration for GNN Autoencoder Training
# This defines which data is used for training vs exploration

training_data:
  sources: ALL

# Configuration for splitting training data into train/val/test
training_splits:
  test_size: 0.20      # 20% for testing
  val_size: 0.20       # 20% for validation
  train_size: 0.60     # 60% for training

  # CRITICAL: Stratification strategy to prevent data leakage
  # Options:
  #   "subject" - Split by subject ID (RECOMMENDED for generalization to new subjects)
  #   "recording" - Split by recording ID (may have subject-level leakage)
  #   "random" - Random split (NOT RECOMMENDED - has data leakage)
  stratify_by: "subject"  # Ensures subjects are balanced across splits - PREVENTS SUBJECT-LEVEL DATA LEAKAGE

  random_seed: 42

# Data leakage prevention notes:
# - Subject-aware splitting ensures the model is tested on completely new subjects
# - This prevents the model from learning subject-specific body geometry rather than breathing patterns
# - Critical for proper evaluation of model generalization capabilities
